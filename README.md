# ChemQA Benchmark Dataset

Welcome to the ChemQA Benchmark Dataset repository! This repository contains the dataset and benchmarking scripts for evaluating the performance of large language models (LLMs) on multiple-choice chemistry questions.

## Overview 

During a hackathon, we created a structured dataset consisting of 80K multiple-choice chemistry questions and answers. This dataset is designed to test the capabilities of LLMs, such as Claude Opus, GPT-4V, and Gemini 2.0 Pro, in understanding and answering chemistry-related queries. 

## Dataset

The dataset is hosted on Hugging Face. Please refer to [ChemQA](huggingface.co/datasets/shangzhu/ChemQA) on Hugging Face for accessing the dataset.
